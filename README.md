# LightHouse

... a business application framework, brought to you with dedication and passion by Turneo (www.turneo.com).

We are slowly uploading LightHouse to GitHub. This will be a process of several weeks/month. We want to be sure that all uploaded code is consistent, tested and well documented. As such we are moving forward step by step.

You will find in every LightHouse component a Code, Documentation and Testing folder. The Code folder contains the source code, the Documentation folder contains all related documents like drafts, specifications, guidelines and how-to's. The Testing folder contains the unit and integration tests for the different platforms.

More information about LightHouse can be found in the following readme and wiki:

[README.md](https://github.com/Turneo/LightHouse/blob/master/Documentation/README.md)
