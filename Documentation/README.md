# LightHouse

As an extensible business application framework LightHouse can be extended by creating custom extensions. 

A basic LightHouse business application requires as a minimum an Application, Model, Execution and Storage extension. Normaly it would be extended with a Presentation extension and in more complex scenarios enriched by a Charting, Security or Testing extension.

Out of the box, LightHouse offers the following extensions, that can customized further as required.

## Application
